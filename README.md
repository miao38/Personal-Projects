# Titanic
Used the random forest model to predict who would survive on the titanic based off of many features.
One example of the features were their titles. Some were Mr., Mrs., Ms., etc. There were also some more 
rare titles like master. I gave all the most common titles their own numberical value while grouping all
the rarer titles together.

This was my first exposurer to machine learning. So I tested a bunch of other models, but the random forest
model came out with the best result.
